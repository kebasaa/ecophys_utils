    "# Mass-based adjustment of stomatal conductance\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is taken from the supplement of \"Leaf carbon monoxide emissions under different drought, heat, and light conditions in the field\" (Muller et al. 2025), see https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.20424\n",
    "\n",
    "A gas (subscript $g$) flux $F_g$ ($mol~m^{-2}~s^{-1}$) can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F_g = g~(C_{g,i} - C_{g,a})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is the leaf conductance to gas transport ($mol~m^{-2}~s^{-1}$) from the internal stomatal space to ambient air, and $C_{g,i}$ and $C_{g,a}$ ($mol~mol^{-1}$) are the gas mole fractions of the intercellular space and the air, respectively. For ecosystem studies, $g$ is composed of leaf boundary layer ($g_{b}$) and stomatal conductance ($g_{s}$): $g = (1/g_{s} +1/g_{b})^{-1}$. In chamber measurements, fans used are assumed *to provide enough ventilation to render the boundary layer component negligible* Seibt et al. (2010), i.e. $g \\approx g_{s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships between stomatal conductances for two different gases correspond to the ratio of their diffusivities. As conductance of water vapour ($g_w$, subscript $w$) can be most easily measured, this ratio ($R_{w-g}$) will be expressed as that between it and the gas of interest, by which the measured $g_w$ is divided to obtain the gas conductance ($g_g$):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "g_g = \\frac{g_w}{R_{w-g}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_{w-g}$ is the ratio of the diffusivities of water vapour ($D_{a,w}$) and the gas ($D_{a,g}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "R_{w-g} = \\frac{D_{a,w}}{D_{a,g}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D_{a,w}$ and $D_{a,g}$ are the diffusion coefficients ($cm^2~s^{-1}$) of water vapour and the gas of interest in the air (subscript $g$). These coefficients can be calculated from the Chapman-Enskog theory (Eq. 17.3-12 in Bird et al., 2007):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "D_{a,g} = \\frac{3}{16} \\sqrt{ \\frac{2~(RT)^3}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{M_a} + \\frac{1}{M_g} \\right)}~\\frac{1}{N_A P \\sigma^2_{a,g} \\Omega_{a,g}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ ($8.31446261815~J~K^{-1}~mol^{-1}$) is the gas constant, $T$ ($K$) is temperature, $M$ (converted to $kg~mol^{-1}$) is the molar mass of the gas, $N_A$ ($6.02214076e23~mol^{-1}$) is the Avogadro constant, $P$ ($Pa$) is ambient pressure, $\\sigma_{a,g} =(\\sigma_a + \\sigma_g)/2$ (converted to $m$) is the collision diameter of the molecules, and $\\Omega_{a,g}$ is the dimensionless collision integral for diffusion. As in Seibt et al. (2010), this approach was chosen because it provides molecular parameters for all three gases (air, water, and the gas of interest). Values for air, $H_2O$, $CO$, $CO_2$ and COS are calculated below based on Table E.1 in Bird et al. (2007). In the current study, all estimates were derived for a temperature of $23°C$ and a standard ambient pressure of $101325~Pa$, since it is assumed that the effect of temperature on the ratios of diffusivities is small for plants under typical field conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "($\\Omega_{a,g}$) is obtained from the following empirical equation (Eq. E.2-2 in Bird et al., 2007):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Omega_{a,g} = \\frac{1.06036}{T_*^{0.15610}} + \\frac{0.19300}{e^{0.47635 T_*}} + \\frac{1.03587}{e^{1.52996 T_*}} + \\frac{1.76474}{e^{3.89411 T_*}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_*$ corresponds to $\\kappa T / \\varepsilon$. This term is obtained from ambient temperature ($T = 23°C = 293.15~K$) and $\\varepsilon / \\kappa$ obtained from Table E.1 in Bird et al. (2007) for each gas:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\varepsilon / \\kappa = \\sqrt{(\\varepsilon / \\kappa)_g ~ (\\varepsilon / \\kappa)_w}\n",
